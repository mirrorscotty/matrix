matrix
======
This is a library for manipulating matricies. Currently, both 2D matricies and
1D vectors are supported. To generate a static library, run "make." Including
the matrix.h file in a C source file will import all definitions in the library.

2dmatrix
--------
Includes a set of functions for performing simple matrix operations. Supported
operations include importing from and exporting to CSV files, standard matrix
arithmetic, and solving linear matrix equations.

vector
------
Functions to create and modify vectors of arbitrary length, as well as perform
simple vector arithmetic.
